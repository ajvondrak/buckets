"""UCI Puzzle - Buckets

You're out hiking with friends and everyone's getting hungry. You have a packet
of soup mix, and its recipe requires exactly 4 quarts of water. Unfortunately,
you forgot your 4-quart cooking pot at home. All you have is a 5-quart pot and
a 3-quart pot. There is a stream nearby, so you have an unlimited source of
water. How will you use the 5-quart pot and the 3-quart pot to measure exactly
4 quarts of water?
